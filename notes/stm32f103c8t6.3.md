### Qt Creator

Notes to build a C++ program for STM32 ARM microcontroller families using Qt Creator.

#### Setup:

1. Download the **toolchain** and add it to *Qt Creator* as a compiler.

2. Download the **cube drivers** from the link above.

3. Add **ObKo's CMake helper** to the project as a submodule.

4. Add CMake helpers as `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` to the project's CMake file.

   ```cmake
   set(CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/stm32_gcc.cmake)
   ```

5. Set Toolchain and Cube Driver path variables.

   ```cmake
   set(STM32_TOOLCHAIN_PATH "path/to/toolchainroot" CACHE STRING "Toolchain Path")
   set(STM32_CUBE_F1_PATH "path/to/STM32CubeFx-x.x.x" CACHE STRING "Cube Root Path")
   set(TARGET_TRIPLET arm-none-eabi CACHE STRING "")
   ```

6. Add target link libraries to the executable:

   ```cmake
   target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}
       HAL::STM32::F1::LL_RCC
       HAL::STM32::F1::LL_GPIO
       CMSIS::STM32::F1
       STM32::NoSys
   )
   stm32_print_size_of_target(${PROJECT_NAME})
   ```

7. Define the family type for the executable (i.e `STM32F103xB`):

   ```cmake
   target_compile_definitions(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE STM32F103xB)
   ```

8. Add the linker script. (Use the template located in `share/gcc-arm-none-eabi/samples/ldscripts/gcc.ld`)

   ```cmake
   stm32_add_linker_script(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE gcc.ld)
   ```

9. Add the startup assembly to the executable. (Use the template located in `share/gcc-arm-none-eabi/samples/startup/startup_ARMCM3.s` or the one provided by *[CMSIS_5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5/master/Device/ARM/ARMCM3/Source/GCC/startup_ARMCM3.S)*)

   ```cmake
   add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME}
       main.cpp
       startup_ARMCM3.s
   )
   ```

#### Run:

1. Add the *upload command* to the IDE's run script:

   ```bash
   ST-LINK_CLI.exe -c -P %{Project:Name}.hex -Run
   ```

*You're done, enjoy!* :tada:
