## Data Transmit protocols
+ **I²C bus**
+ **Universal synchronous/asynchronous receiver transmitter (USART)**<br>
One of the USART interfaces is able to communicate at speeds of up to 4.5 Mbit/s.
+ **Serial peripheral interface (SPI)**<br>
Up to two SPIs are able to communicate up to 18 Mbits/s in slave and master modes in full-duplex and simplex communication modes.
+ **Controller area network (CAN)**<br>
+ **Universal serial bus (USB)**<br>
The STM32F103xx performance line embeds a USB device peripheral compatible with the
USB full-speed 12 Mbs.

## Low-power modes
+ **Sleep mode**: CPU stop, interrupts can wakeup CPU.
+ **Stop mode**:  lowest power consumption while retaining the content of SRAM and registers. The device can be woken up from Stop mode by any of the EXTI line.
+ **Standby mode**: After entering Standby mode, SRAM and register contents are *lost*. Exits *Standby* when an **NRST pin**, an **IWDG reset**, a
rising edge on the **WKUP pin**, or an **RTC alarm** occurs.

## Boot modes
At startup, boot pins are used to select one of three boot options:
+ **Boot from user Flash**
+ **Boot from System memory**
+ **Boot from embedded SRAM**

The boot loader is located in *System memory*. It is used to reprogram the Flash memory by using **USART1**. For further details refer to `AN2606`, available on [www.st.com](https://www.st.com).

## Type of reset
+ **System Reset**
+ **Power Reset**
+ **Backup Domain**

## Power supply supervisor
The device has an integrated power-on reset (`POR`) / power-down reset (`PDR`) circuitry.
Which **ensures** proper operation starting from/down to **2 V**.
The device **remains in reset** mode when `VDD` is below a specified threshold, `VPOR/PDR`, without the need for an external reset circuit.

## VBAT
The real-time clock (RTC) and backup registers can be powered from the [V<sub>BAT</sub>](#vbat) voltage when the main VDD supply is powered off.

-- *[see [RM0008, chapter 5.1, p. 67-68](#rm0008)]*.

## PC13, PC14 and PC15 Pins
`PC13`, `PC14` and `PC15` are supplied through the power switch.
Since the switch only sinks a limited amount of current (3 mA), the use of GPIOs PC13 to PC15 in output mode is limited: the speed should not exceed 2 MHz with a maximum load of 30 pF and these IOs must not be used as a current source (e.g. to drive a LED).

## Tamper
The purpose is to protect the device content and functionality against external attacks, This is required for secure applications. In case of intrusion, sensitive data are automatically erased. 1 tamper input pins and events is supported, and is functional in all low-power modes and in VBAT mode.

-- *[see [RM0008, chapter 5.1, p. 67-68](#rm0008)]*.

## Temperature sensor

The temperature sensor has to generate a voltage that varies linearly with temperature. The conversion range is between 2V &le; `VDDA` &le; 3.6V. The ***temperature sensor is internally connected*** to the `ADC12_IN16` input channel which is used to convert the sensor output voltage into a digital value.

> **NOTE**:  Internal temperature sensor is useful for diagnostic purposes and monitoring the device's internal temperature, **It should not be relied upon for accurate measurements of the external environment temperature**.

## Timers

Each timer has its own prescaler. We use prescalers to set the count speed for the timers.

*Hint: On a microcontroller, there are some protection diodes that are connected to the V<sub>CC</sub> pin. Therefore, if you connect input power to one of the inputs and remove the input power supply, the microcontroller will continue to work.*
